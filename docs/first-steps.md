## First Steps
<ol>
<li>Cardiology Document Management System is a web application. If you are using the cloud (online version) the access path is <a href="https://cardiodocs.lk">https://cardiodocs.lk </a> Note <b>https</b> means secure connection. If you are using a locally deployed version – then the access path is <a href="http://192.168.1.123/">http://192.168.1.123/</a> which is unsecure at the browser. This type of deployment will be phased out.   
</li>
</p>
<li>Because of various technical issues (especially regards to PACS), <b> CDMS runs best on Firefox web browser </b>. Firefox is a fantastic, privacy focused web browser, built by a voluntary group of dedicated professionals who are committed to an open and standards compliant modern internet – unlike Chrome and Edge. <a href="https://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Click here to get the latest version of FireFox for your computer </a> 
</li>
</p>
<li>
CDMS is a <b>Single Page web Application - SPA </b> – therefore unlike traditional websites, there are no visible page loads. Everything happens in the same page – just like a desktop application. This great user experience requires considerable computing power and network bandwidth – therefore if there are connection issues – this Yellow error bar may appear.
</li>

</p>    
<li>
If you see this error bar, press the browser refresh button to reload the page. In vast majority of pages, any data that the user may have been entering WON’T be lost. 

</li>
</p> 
<li>

Except for ECG access, all other activities require the user to login to the system with a username and a password. 

</li>
</p> 
<li>

ECG access is password less at the moment as we need to provide rapid access to ECGs (e.g., in Acute coronary events) to people who may not have a user account to CDMS (see ECG access on CDMS user guide) 
</p> 

</li>
</p> 
<li>


The background colour theme of CDMS is dark – because most of cardiology work happens in darkened environments (echo room, cath lab, theatre) and is much easier on the eye to have a dark theme.

Please adjust your browser's zoom setting. It should be 100% for optimal viewing.
